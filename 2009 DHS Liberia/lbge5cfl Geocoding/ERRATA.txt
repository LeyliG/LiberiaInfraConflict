Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Liberia 2009 MIS GPS data.  
All of the GPS data was recollected during the 2011 MIS, which used the same sample frame as the 2009 MIS.
GPS readings from 2011 were more precise for 19 clusters, therefore the 2009 MIS GPS data has now been
adjusted for the 19 clusters. 

The following clusters' coordinates have been updated to reflect the more accurate locations: 
4,15,25,35,37,49,53,64,65,66,77,81,85,96,100,102,104,106,109.


These issues have been resolved in the newly issued dataset LBGE5CFL.  Please use these data 
for any analyses and disregard the previous dataset.  We apologize for any confusion this may 
cause you.
